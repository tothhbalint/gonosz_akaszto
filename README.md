# About 
This was my first bigger project in university. The goal of it was to practice C.
The game I wrote is a modified version of hangman, where the game doesn't have a word for the player to guess in the beginning, it constantly alters it as the player is guessing.

# Build and run
To build you have to run:
```
gcc *.c -o gonosz_akaszto -lm
```
To run it just type:
```
./gonosz_akaszto
```
